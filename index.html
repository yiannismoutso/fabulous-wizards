we compare skillsets that our team currently have with skillsets that demand that most employers are seeking. We conclude that our team are cultivating most interpersonal skills that employers are looking along the way while we are working on Assignment 2. Interpersonal skills that our team developed while we are working on Assignment 2 includes “communication skill”,”team work/collaboration skill” and “writing skill”. Although our team’s members may not possess most aspects of IT-specific skills that we learnt on Burning Glass studies indicated, we are confident that we will learn during BP162 program with various aspects of IT technologies RMIT University is offering.
After having looked at the Burning Glass data and studied, our team member’s opinions of ideal job does not change. However, one aspect we agree that we need to complete a degree program that we enrol into so that this will allow us to continue career path pursuant to. </p>

<h2>IT work</h2>
<p>This team chose to interview an IT Professional. We approached an IT professional who is working for Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
ATO is s a government organization which is dealing with taxation, superannuation, and accounting for the Australian community. He is currently working as a Senior Data Engineer, in which his role involves developing applications and tools to store and access big data sets. He is responsible for developing applications that process the raw data e.g. xml file, text file then validate data based on business requirement and transform data into big data format.
Apart from working with data, he is routinely involved in project management as well, which is the processing to make sure projects run smoothly, within scope, time, and project grant.
He needs to interact and work with other IT professionals. There are other IT professionals involve whose roles are such as Business Analysis, Project managers, Team leader, other developers, Business development managers etc. In his role, communication skill plays an important role. His interactions with other IT professionals such as Business Analysis includes making clear that he understands the task and requirements set forth clearly, making sure the task and/or his code is working as they expect. 
His role doesn’t involve direct interaction with investors; however, his role requires him to interact with other clients who are using the application. He needs to get involved running training sessions to clients in certain occasions.
The most challenging part of his work is writing testing code because testing code supposed to prove that “the unexpected error occur”. Testing is the process of executing a program with the objective of finding error in a program. In his own words, he said, “The normal coding is expecting things to go right, but testing code is expecting things to go wrong.”
He shared his view on the essence of IT industry too. He believes that data is everywhere today. He argued that hardware itself cannot be stored and processed without data-driven application. </p>
<h2>IT technologies</h2>
<p>Cyber security is the progress of protecting networks, systems, programs, and data from cyber-attacks. These attacks are aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information of a company. A successful cyber security approach has layers of protection on the computers, networks, programs, or data that people intend to keep safe. They also can be done to extort money. An effective defence against a cyber-attack requires the cooperation of many components to be successful. This means that a cyber security system doesn’t only rely on cyber defence technology but also relies on people making smart cyber defence choices. Organizations with a fine cybersecurity strategy uses the tools of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, which helps fight cyberthreats more effectively and impacts breaches when they occur. A strong cybersecurity strategy has layers of protections to defend against cybercrime. The protections are as follows:
Critical infrastructure security: practises for protecting the computer systems, networks, and other assets that rely on up national security, economic health and public safety. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a cybersecurity framework to help organizations in this area, while the U.S department of Homeland Security provides additional guidance.

<h4>Network Security:</h4> <p>protecting a computer network from intruders, including both wired and wireless connections.</p>

<h4>Application security:</h4> <p>help protect applications operating on premises and in the cloud. Security should be built into applications at the design stage, with considerations for how data is handled, user authentications, etc.</p>

<h4>Cloud security:</h4> <p>computing that encrypts cloud data in storage and as it travels to, from and within the cloud, to support customer privacy, business requirements and regulatory compliance standards.</p>

<h4>Information security:</h4> <p>data protection measures such as the General Data Protection Regulation that secure the most sensitive data from theft, exposure, and unauthorized access.</p>

<h4>End- user education:</h4> <p>building security awareness across the organization to strengthen endpoint security. For example, users can be trained to delete suspicious email attachments, avoid using unknown USB devices. </p>

<h4>Disaster recovery:</h4> <p>tools and procedures for responding to unplanned events such as natural disasters, power outages, or cyberattacks, with minimal to no disruption to key operations.</p>

<h4>Storage security:</h4> <p>includes encryption, immutable and isolated data copies. These remain in the same pool so they can quickly be restored to support recovery, minimizing the impact of a cyber-attack.</p>

<h4>Mobile security:</h4> <p>enables you to manage and secure your mobile workforce with app security, container app security and secure mobile email.</p>

<h3>Key cybersecurity technologies and best practises</h3>
<h4>Identity and access management (IAM)</h4>: <p>this defines the roles for each user and their conditions which they are granted for their privileges. Methodologies include sign-on, which enables the user to log in to a network once without re-entering their credentials again during the same session. Multifactor authentication makes it safer for the user because it requires two or more access credentials. Privileged user accounts grant privileges to certain users only. IAM tools can also provide deeper visibility to cybersecurity professionals, including end points they can’t physically access.</p>
<h4>Comprehensive data security platform</h4> <p> protects sensitive information across multi cloud environments. It also has ongoing monitoring that alerts them to data vulnerabilities and risks before they become data breaches. Backups and encryption are vital for keeping data safe.</p>
<h4>Security information and event management (SIEM):</h4> <p>analyses data from security events to automatically delete suspicious user activities and trigger an immediate response. SIEM solutions include advanced detection methods such as behaviour analytics and artificial intelligence. They can automatically prioritize cyber threat response in line with your organization’s risk management objectives.</p>
These technologies better cyber security by reducing the vulnerability to cyber-attacks and protecting critical information systems, without making user or customer service worse.
Cyber security isn’t going to slow down any time soon. The International Data Corporation forecasts that worldwide cyber security spending will reach $174.7 billion by 2024. Cyber-attacks will never stop, especially ransomware, which fuels the cyber insurance market. As technology is taking over the world, cyber security will be one of the main things companies will need in the upcoming years. One of the biggest aspects that have experienced the most growth in the last 10 years, it’s the use of cloud. According to Hunt, cloud makes it faster, cheaper and easier than ever to put services online and collect huge amounts of data. They believe that the cloud will grow more in the next 10 years and more people will start using it. However, Cohen Wood, predicts that the future of cloud might be short “the cloud might evaporate in 2031”. She anticipates a system of peer-to-peer, which each network carries different types of traffic for different types of communication. She also adds that “things will swing towards the peer-to-peer system for a while, but eventually it will swing back to cloud because that’s how it works. History has proven that time and time again.” Grimes supports that the same attacks that allow thieves steal our passwords, will be the same in 10 years. Although, all 3 experts have said that the use of AI will be even more critical. Grimes believes that the AI will be the catalyst in determining whether the industry can keep up with all the cyberattacks. Just like the AI, data breaches are expected to be more common in 2031 than what they are now. Hunt has been saying that there are numerous factors that will worsen data breaches as cybersecurity approaches. Finally, there is an overwhelming number of unfilled cybersecurity positions. Personally, I want a job in cybersecurity and this fact will help me start my career as there is great need in this matter.
<h4>An autonomous vehicle</h4> <p>An autonomous vehicle can drive by itself from a point A to B. It’s capable of sensing its environment and can work without human involvement. There are different levels to driving automation. Level 0, which is fully manual and level 5, which is fully autonomous. Level 0 to level 2 is where the driving environment is mostly controlled by a human, but the car has features like performing steering like lane assist or accelerating/ staying at the same speed as cruise control. Level 3 to level 5 is more automated as the system monitors the driving environment without the human having to get involved. The person can still override and act if it’s necessary, but they don’t have to. These vehicles rely on sensors, algorithms, machine learning systems and powerful processors to execute software. With these features, they create a map of their surroundings based on the sensors located on different parts of the vehicle. Video cameras detect traffic lights, read road signs, track other vehicles, and look for pedestrians. Ultrasonic sensors in the wheels detect curbs other vehicles to make it able for the vehicle to park. A sophisticated software then processes all these sensors and sends signals to the car’s actuators which then controls acceleration, braking and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modelling, and object recognition help the software follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. Obviously, fully autonomous cars are still undergoing testing. None are available to the public just yet. There are a few challenges ranging from technological to environmental and philosophical. Lidar (light detection) is expensive and is still improving to find the right balance between range and resolution. For instance, if multiple autonomous cars were driving on the same road, would their lidar signals interfere? If there’s snow on the road, lane dividers would be hard to spot. Will the cameras and sensors be able to track them? Will they have problems in tunnels and bridges? What happens on the event of an accident, who would be liable for it? the passenger? The manufacturer? The level 5 fully autonomous vehicles don’t have a dashboard nor a steering wheel, so a human passenger won’t have the option to take control in an emergency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the future, these vehicles could be upgraded that they communicate with each other so less accidents could occur. There are many unanswered questions now for these vehicles. This is a project that will be fully experimented in the future. However, there is many benefits if these vehicles became a daily transportation. The convenience and quality of life improvements are limitless. The elderly and the physically disabled would be able to travel from place to place and be independent. The main benefit of this project would be the lowered CO2 emissions. In a recent study from the ITDP, experts believe that if the trends of vehicle automation, vehicle electrification and ridesharing adopted concurrently, they would unleash the full potential of autonomous cars. By 2050, these revolutions could reduce traffic congest by 30%, cut transportation costs by 40%, improve walkability and liveability and reduce urban CO2 emissions by 80% worldwide. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles ae expected to be safer. “These cars won’t get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risks- things that people do all the time,” Chase said. This would make the passengers of the automatic vehicle more comfortable, more relaxed and safer. Since these vehicles are trained to be safer.</p>
<p>As said above, with sensors and cameras, they can enhance the safety of the passenger and other cars. There are also passive safety features such as seatbelt and airbags to minimise accidents, but the most effective way to improve safety would be to prevent the collision altogether. It has the potential to remove human error, thus reducing accidents and fatalities. According to the global traffic scorecard of INRIX, an organization measuring traffic data shows that citizens in the US lost on average 97    hours a year due to congestion. The cost of this is nearly $87 billion in 2018, $1,348 per driver. In contrast, a lot of workers could lose their jobs due to this. Of all workers in the US, 2,9% have a job that requires driving. Despite these potential benefits, self-driving cars raise many challenges. It is not clear who is liable if a self-driving car gets into an accident. Another challenge is how to prepare when people no longer need to own a car. Another challenge is the possibility of hacking. While they rely on technology like GPS, wireless signals and video feeds, they can easily get hacked by criminals to cause accidents or gain access to personal information. Many people worry that computers will make even more mistakes than what humans do, and the passengers might not have enough time to take control to avoid an accident. In conclusion, these vehicles have the potential to affect society in both good and bad ways.</p>

<h4>Blockchain</h4> <p>Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency. It’s a database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. They store information electronically in a digital format. Blockchains withstand an important part in cryptocurrency systems, refer to the disturbed databases to which are shared in the nodes of computer networks and consist of databases that have the ability to store able to store information, generate fidelity and secures a record of data electronically in digital formats through blockchains.
Blockchains holds information together in groups referred to as ‘blocks. The main distinguishable component of databases and blockchains is the way in which it is structured. There is a certain capacity to blocks which causes them to close and link to previously filled blocks creating blockchains. New information that contains new blocks is then formed into a new chain once it is compiled with new blocks which contain new information. These databases are formed in tables in comparison to blockchains which are in sections of blocks compiled together.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a useful form of currency preventing counterfeit, through its secure nature due to cryptography. The sole base of cryptocurrency holding it together is the decentralized networks which are formatted through blockchain technology. Furthermore, cryptocurrency is not regulated by an authority preventing government control.</p>
<p>Crypto and blockchains positively allow humans to safely use the currency without the ability of outer parties interfering with transactions, allowing money to arrive safely. Blockchains improve the efficiency of transactions by speeding up the process of transactions and allowing the transactions to be more protected and safer. Additionally, cybersecurity, being a key feature in crypto and blockchains allows data from transactions to be encrypted in blockchain through cryptography, thus, preventing it from being tampered with from unauthorized alterations and hackers.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is beneficial to consumers as it protects personal information, it is self-managed and allows for faster and more efficient transfers. The downside to crypto is that its scalability is based on the public and without the publics usage its value and scalability is decreased. It is also noted that consumers may also encounter certain cybersecurity issues through its use. Cryptocurrency’s transparency majorly advances currency from banks as it is not regulated by a third party and allows for improved privacy. Another major advantage of crypto is that it is much less affected from inflation due to it depending on global demand rather than national demand. A downside of crypto is that it is still not proven to be a worthy long-term investment and use due to it still not being the main form of currency used and still heavily relies on global scalability.</p>
<p>The future of cryptocurrency and blockchain is that it may slowly but surely become the main form of transactions used globally. The safety and secureness of information being encrypted in blockchains allows for better privacy and safety through transactions. In the near future there may be an increase in usage of cryptocurrency and the scalability of blockchains and crypto will be increased. Cryptocurrency is becoming well known and more popular throughout the entire world. It could make the world a better place. One of its benefits is that it can reduce the risk of fraud. Fraud is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to money. Crypto is not linked to your bank account or your cash funds. It is transferred electronically and securely with the blockchain recording all transactions. E-commerce will become stronger as everyone already makes most of their purchases online. Since there will be no concerns of fraud, there will be more opportunities for world-wide business.</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of scientific advancements in the last 100 years. Cryptocurrency and blockchain can change the scientific roadblocks by providing access to everyone to real-time data and eliminating all the foundations sitting on important information. The company, Nano Vision, is already working on a platform that will allow every person to participate in making further advancements. This system uses molecular data at a global scale using blockchain and a new crypto asset to share data and resources. In addition to reducing fraud, cryptocurrency can help make foreign money transfers safer. The use of crypto reduces the danger of carrying cash and eliminates exchange and transaction fees. Plus, the risk of robberies would be reduced. Cryptocurrency is the technology of the future. </p>
<h4>Robotics</h4> <p>is the science and engineering that produces machines, called robots that replicate human actions. They consist of mechanical arms. They are programmable machines that are built to assist humans. They were originally built to handle monotonous tasks, but they have expanded their abilities to perform tasks like cleaning homes, fighting fires and even perform surgeries. Each robot has different abilities. Some are controlled by humans and perform tasks that a human has full control of, and others are
fully autonomous that perform tasks without a human influence.</p>
<p>As technology progresses, so do robotics. In 2005, robots were mainly found assembling cars in automotive factories. They consist of mechanical arms that are tasked to weld or screw certain parts of a car. Today, robots are that expanded, that assist in earth’s harshest conditions and even in healthcare.</p>
<p>There are a few types of robots. They come in different shapes and sizes depending on the task they need to do. They vary in design, functionality and autonomy. Robots these days are design to carry out tasks that humans can’t do. Normally, there are 5 types of robots:</p>
<p>Pre-programmed robots operate in an environment where they do simple tasks. An example of a robot like that would be a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line. The arm welds the door, to then insert a part into the engine. Its task is to perform this job for longer, faster and more efficiently than a human.</p>
<p>Humanoid robots mimic human behaviour. They perform activities like walking, running, jumping and carrying objects. Some of them even look like us, by having human faces and expressions.</p>
<p>Autonomous robots operate in open environments that do not require human influence. They use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then apply decision-making structures to take the next step depending on the task they are performing. An example of an autonomous robot would be the Roomba vacuum cleaner, senses the house to roam freely throughout a home.</p>
<p>Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous bots that use a wireless network to enable human control from a distance. They usually work in extreme geographical conditions. Examples of teleoperated robots are human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks.</p>
<p>Augmenting robots enhance capabilities that a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are exoskeletons used to lift very heavy weights.</p>
<p>The way robots’ function is that they are capable of being completely autonomous and independent from humans. They require more intense programming but allow robots to do tasks where the environment is not appropriate for humans. However, they are the most disruptive to society, eliminating low-wage jobs but at the same tie presenting new possibilities for growth. Dependent robots are non-autonomous robots that interact with humans to improve their abilities. A famous example of a dependent robot was created for a man whose arm was amputated. He was fitted with an MPL as a test so researchers could study its use for potential improvements and risks. The MPL was controlled by via electromyography and signals being sent from his amputated graph that controls the prosthesis. Over time, he became more efficient in controlling it and the signals sent became smaller and less variable, leading to more accuracy in its movements and allowing him to perform more complicated tasks.</p>
<p>Robots are built to present solutions to various needs and fulfills several different purposes. Therefore, they require a variety of components that to complete these tasks. However, there are several components that are necessary to the robot’s construction, like a power source. Computation includes all the components that make up a robot’s control system. The control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its components, similar to how the human brain sends signals to the body. Sensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals. This helps the robot sense what’s around it so it can interact with the outside world. These include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. Actuators can be made of a variety of materials, such as metal and elastic. They are commonly operated by air (pneumatic operators) or oil (hydraulic actuators). A robot device can be considered a robot only if it has a movable frame. Actuators are responsible for the movement. The components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move to carry out the movement necessary to complete a task.</p>
<p>In some industries, robots are replacing human jobs, which can create economic problems. After all, robots can only do what they are told to do, meaning they can’t expand their abilities. Robots cannot compete with human’s eyesight. Robots can’t compete with a human’s ability to understand what they see. The robots’ initial cost would be very expensive. Maintenance and the need for extra components would also be very expensive.</p>
<p>It's unlikely for AI’s to take over the world as the robots’ brain cannot compete with the one of the humans. Business network PwC predicts that up to 30% of jobs could be automated by robots by the mid-2030s. Other reports predict that the stock of robots could reach 20 million by 2030, with automated workers taking up 51 million jobs in the next 10 years. While they may not complete take over the world, we can expect to see more robots in our daily lives.</p>

<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
<p>We discussed various aspects of IT technologies during our meetings. Our team members agreed to come up with a feasible project idea. It is basically a transaction-based application which will capture deposit, withdrawal, and other activity in essence.
Fingerprint based ATM is a project involving the use of fingerprints as a new form of authentication within ATM’s. This would be a more efficient and safer process of using ATMs as each person has a unique fingerprint; therefore, ensuring a safer way to access your bank. The use of cards would be an outdated form, with users not required to carry it around, thus parting with the worries of losing or having your card stolen. The user would also be required to enter a pin to proceed with transactions to ensure two-factor authentication and install a greater security.
ATMs do not require the holder of the card to be present. If a card is stolen and the pin number is ascertained, an authorised person can easily access the account. Fingerprints provide a more secure way of accessing your account as your fingerprint is different to everyone else’s.
Since there are only two members are actively in discussion about project ideas in this Assignment 2. There is one aspect we are certain that we are excited to learn and work toward the progress of project called “fabulous wizards”.
The aim of our team’s project is to innovate a better security system by using fingerprint-based scanning in the ATM system. </p>

<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
<p>There are two active team members who contributed to this Assignment 2 - Ioannis Moutsopoulos and Zin Aung Phyo.
We acknowledged that this Assignment 2 is challenging because there are only two project team members contributing to complete this group assignment in comparison of other groups.
It was hard to organise team meetings as we have various personal constraints and limitations due to the fact that COVID-19 pandemic concern’s is around and RMIT University is practicing COVIDSafe protocols  ; however we hoped we are trying our best to achieve what was set out in Assignment 2.
We were surprised to learn that there are some disagreements in group project though how well we organised. </p>
