Interpersonal skills that our team developed while we are working on Assignment 2 includes “communication skill”,”team work/collaboration skill” and “writing skill”. Although our team’s members may not possess most aspects of IT-specific skills that we learnt on Burning Glass studies indicated, we are confident that we will learn during BP162 program with various aspects of IT technologies RMIT University is offering.
After having looked at the Burning Glass data and studied, our team member’s opinions of ideal job does not change. However, one aspect we agree that we need to complete a degree program that we enrol into so that this will allow us to continue career path pursuant to. </p>

<h2>IT work</h2>
<p>This team chose to interview an IT Professional. We approached an IT professional who is working for Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
ATO is s a government organization which is dealing with taxation, superannuation, and accounting for the Australian community. He is currently working as a Senior Data Engineer, in which his role involves developing applications and tools to store and access big data sets. He is responsible for developing applications that process the raw data e.g. xml file, text file then validate data based on business requirement and transform data into big data format.
Apart from working with data, he is routinely involved in project management as well, which is the processing to make sure projects run smoothly, within scope, time, and project grant.
He needs to interact and work with other IT professionals. There are other IT professionals involve whose roles are such as Business Analysis, Project managers, Team leader, other developers, Business development managers etc. In his role, communication skill plays an important role. His interactions with other IT professionals such as Business Analysis includes making clear that he understands the task and requirements set forth clearly, making sure the task and/or his code is working as they expect. 
His role doesn’t involve direct interaction with investors; however, his role requires him to interact with other clients who are using the application. He needs to get involved running training sessions to clients in certain occasions.
The most challenging part of his work is writing testing code because testing code supposed to prove that “the unexpected error occur”. Testing is the process of executing a program with the objective of finding error in a program. In his own words, he said, “The normal coding is expecting things to go right, but testing code is expecting things to go wrong.”
He shared his view on the essence of IT industry too. He believes that data is everywhere today. He argued that hardware itself cannot be stored and processed without data-driven application. </p>
<h2>IT technologies</h2>
<p>Cyber security is the progress of protecting networks, systems, programs, and data from cyber-attacks. These attacks are aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information of a company. A successful cyber security approach has layers of protection on the computers, networks, programs, or data that people intend to keep safe. They also can be done to extort money. An effective defence against a cyber-attack requires the cooperation of many components to be successful. This means that a cyber security system doesn’t only rely on cyber defence technology but also relies on people making smart cyber defence choices. Organizations with a fine cybersecurity strategy uses the tools of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, which helps fight cyberthreats more effectively and impacts breaches when they occur. A strong cybersecurity strategy has layers of protections to defend against cybercrime. The protections are as follows:
Critical infrastructure security: practises for protecting the computer systems, networks, and other assets that rely on up national security, economic health and public safety. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a cybersecurity framework to help organizations in this area, while the U.S department of Homeland Security provides additional guidance.

<h4>Network Security:</h4> <p>protecting a computer network from intruders, including both wired and wireless connections.</p>

<h4>Application security:</h4> <p>help protect applications operating on premises and in the cloud. Security should be built into applications at the design stage, with considerations for how data is handled, user authentications, etc.</p>

<h4>Cloud security:</h4> <p>computing that encrypts cloud data in storage and as it travels to, from and within the cloud, to support customer privacy, business requirements and regulatory compliance standards.</p>

<h4>Information security:</h4> <p>data protection measures such as the General Data Protection Regulation that secure the most sensitive data from theft, exposure, and unauthorized access.</p>

<h4>End- user education:</h4> <p>building security awareness across the organization to strengthen endpoint security. For example, users can be trained to delete suspicious email attachments, avoid using unknown USB devices. </p>

<h4>Disaster recovery:</h4> <p>tools and procedures for responding to unplanned events such as natural disasters, power outages, or cyberattacks, with minimal to no disruption to key operations.</p>

<h4>Storage security:</h4> <p>includes encryption, immutable and isolated data copies. These remain in the same pool so they can quickly be restored to support recovery, minimizing the impact of a cyber-attack.</p>

<h4>Mobile security:</h4> <p>enables you to manage and secure your mobile workforce with app security, container app security and secure mobile email.</p>

<h3>Key cybersecurity technologies and best practises</h3>
<h4>Identity and access management (IAM)</h4>: <p>this defines the roles for each user and their conditions which they are granted for their privileges. Methodologies include sign-on, which enables the user to log in to a network once without re-entering their credentials again during the same session. Multifactor authentication makes it safer for the user because it requires two or more access credentials. Privileged user accounts grant privileges to certain users only. IAM tools can also provide deeper visibility to cybersecurity professionals, including end points they can’t physically access.</p>
<h4>Comprehensive data security platform</h4> <p> protects sensitive information across multi cloud environments. It also has ongoing monitoring that alerts them to data vulnerabilities and risks before they become data breaches. Backups and encryption are vital for keeping data safe.</p>
<h4>Security information and event management (SIEM):</h4> <p>analyses data from security events to automatically delete suspicious user activities and trigger an immediate response. SIEM solutions include advanced detection methods such as behaviour analytics and artificial intelligence. They can automatically prioritize cyber threat response in line with your organization’s risk management objectives.</p>
These technologies better cyber security by reducing the vulnerability to cyber-attacks and protecting critical information systems, without making user or customer service worse.
Cyber security isn’t going to slow down any time soon. The International Data Corporation forecasts that worldwide cyber security spending will reach $174.7 billion by 2024. Cyber-attacks will never stop, especially ransomware, which fuels the cyber insurance market. As technology is taking over the world, cyber security will be one of the main things companies will need in the upcoming years. One of the biggest aspects that have experienced the most growth in the last 10 years, it’s the use of cloud. According to Hunt, cloud makes it faster, cheaper and easier than ever to put services online and collect huge amounts of data. They believe that the cloud will grow more in the next 10 years and more people will start using it. However, Cohen Wood, predicts that the future of cloud might be short “the cloud might evaporate in 2031”. She anticipates a system of peer-to-peer, which each network carries different types of traffic for different types of communication. She also adds that “things will swing towards the peer-to-peer system for a while, but eventually it will swing back to cloud because that’s how it works. History has proven that time and time again.” Grimes supports that the same attacks that allow thieves steal our passwords, will be the same in 10 years. Although, all 3 experts have said that the use of AI will be even more critical. Grimes believes that the AI will be the catalyst in determining whether the industry can keep up with all the cyberattacks. Just like the AI, data breaches are expected to be more common in 2031 than what they are now. Hunt has been saying that there are numerous factors that will worsen data breaches as cybersecurity approaches. Finally, there is an overwhelming number of unfilled cybersecurity positions. Personally, I want a job in cybersecurity and this fact will help me start my career as there is great need in this matter.
<h4>An autonomous vehicle</h4> <p>can drive by itself from point A to B. It’s capable of sensing its environment and can work without human involvement. There are different levels to driving automation. Level 0, which is fully manual and level 5, which is fully autonomous. Level 0 to level 2 is where the driving environment is mostly controlled by a human, but the car has features like performing steering like lane assist or accelerating/ staying at the same speed as cruise control. Level 3 to level 5 is more automated as the system monitors the driving environment without the human having to get involved. The person can still override and act if it’s necessary, but they don’t have to. These vehicles rely on sensors, algorithms, machine learning systems and powerful processors to execute software. With these features, they create a map of their surroundings based on the sensors located on different parts of the vehicle. Video cameras detect traffic lights, read road signs, track other vehicles, and look for pedestrians. Ultrasonic sensors in the wheels detect curbs other vehicles to make it able for the vehicle to park. A sophisticated software then processes all these sensors and sends signals to the car’s actuators which then controls acceleration, braking and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modelling, and object recognition help the software follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. Obviously, fully autonomous cars are still undergoing testing. None are available to the public just yet. There are a few challenges ranging from technological to environmental and philosophical. Lidar (light detection) is expensive and is still improving to find the right balance between range and resolution. For instance, if multiple autonomous cars were driving on the same road, would their lidar signals interfere? If there’s snow on the road, lane dividers would be hard to spot. Will the cameras and sensors be able to track them? Will they have problems in tunnels and bridges? What happens on the event of an accident, who would be liable for it? the passenger? The manufacturer? The level 5 fully autonomous vehicles don’t have a dashboard nor a steering wheel, so a human passenger won’t have the option to take control in an emergency. There are many unanswered questions now for these vehicles. This is a project that will be fully experimented in the future. However, there is many benefits if these vehicles became a daily transportation. The convenience and quality of life improvements are limitless. The elderly and the physically disabled would be able to travel from place to place and be independent. The main benefit of this project would be the lowered CO2 emissions. In a recent study from the ITDP, experts believe that if the trends of vehicle automation, vehicle electrification and ridesharing adopted concurrently, they would unleash the full potential of autonomous cars. By 2050, these revolutions could reduce traffic congest by 30%, cut transportation costs by 40%, improve walkability and liveability and reduce urban CO2 emissions by 80% worldwide. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles ae expected to be safer. “These cars won’t get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risks- things that people do all the time,” Chase said. </p>

<h4>Blockchain</h4> <p>Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency. It’s a database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. They store information electronically in a digital format. Blockchains withstand an important part in cryptocurrency systems, refer to the disturbed databases to which are shared in the nodes of computer networks and consist of databases that have the ability to store able to store information, generate fidelity and secures a record of data electronically in digital formats through blockchains.

Blockchains holds information together in groups referred to as ‘blocks. The main distinguishable component of databases and blockchains is the way in which it is structured. There is a certain capacity to blocks which causes them to close and link to previously filled blocks creating blockchains. New information that contains new blocks is then formed into a new chain once it is compiled with new blocks which contain new information.

These databases are formed in tables in comparison to blockchains which are in sections of blocks compiled together.

Cryptocurrency is a useful form of currency preventing counterfeit, through its secure nature due to cryptography. The sole base of cryptocurrency holding it together is the decentralized networks which are formatted through blockchain technology. Furthermore, cryptocurrency is not regulated by an authority preventing government control.

Crypto and blockchains positively allow humans to safely use the currency without the ability of outer parties interfering with transactions, allowing money to arrive safely. Blockchains improve the efficiency of transactions by speeding up the process of transactions and allowing the transactions to be more protected and safer. Additionally, cybersecurity, being a key feature in crypto and blockchains allows data from transactions to be encrypted in blockchain through cryptography, thus, preventing it from being tampered with from unauthorized alterations and hackers.

Cryptocurrency is beneficial to consumers as it protects personal information, it is self-managed and allows for faster and more efficient transfers. The downside to crypto is that its scalability is based on the public and without the publics usage its value and scalability is decreased. It is also noted that consumers may also encounter certain cybersecurity issues through its use. Cryptocurrency’s transparency majorly advances currency from banks as it is not regulated by a third party and allows for improved privacy. Another major advantage of crypto is that it is much less affected from inflation due to it depending on global demand rather than national demand. A downside of crypto is that it is still not proven to be a worthy long-term investment and use due to it still not being the main form of currency used and still heavily relies on global scalability.

The future of cryptocurrency and blockchain is that it may slowly but surely become the main form of transactions used globally. The safety and secureness of information being encrypted in blockchains allows for better privacy and safety through transactions. In the near future there may be an increase in usage of cryptocurrency and the scalability of blockchains and crypto will be increased.</p>
